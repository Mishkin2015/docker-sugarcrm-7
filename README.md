# docker-sugarcrm-7
A docker provide to build a sugarcrm 7 container

Actually i'm trying to build it on 7.5 version of Sugar.


To use it you have to specify in your host sugar.dev hostname

127.0.0.1 sugar.dev

Test first before

To configure definitively mysql password see files/startup_mysql
To configure hostnamesee files/vhost.conf

** Now deprecated **
I recommande to use docker compose to make your sugarcrm docker
You can find link to the docker directly here http://developer.sugarcrm.com/2015/10/07/getting-started-with-docker-and-sugar-7/
